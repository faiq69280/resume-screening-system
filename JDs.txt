as a datascientist, you must know python. experience with frameworks like django and flask is preffered. data analysis libraries like pandas and numpy are very helpful. 
pyml models like scikitlearn are also very desired. In short, the user must know the following : sklearn,matplotlib,scipy, bokeh and statsmodel are expected to be found in the candidates. 
@
very important to know statistical models and statistical modeling. probability distributions like normal distribution, poisson distribution are a must. survival models and hypothesis testing techniques 
are expected. bayesian inference, factor analysis and forecasting are also needed. the candidate should have some experience with markov chains and monte carlo technique.
@
we expect our candidates to understand laws package and should have comfortability dealing with ec2. amazon redshift, s3 and docker should be on fingertips. expertise with kubernetes, scala and teradata 
are the skills we look forward to. big data skills like google big query, laws lambda, laws emr and hive are also desirable. experience with hadooop and sql is also expected.
